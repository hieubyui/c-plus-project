# Overview
I made this program to learn C++. I created a riddle game where a Sphinx asks you 3 riddles, and if you answer all 3 correctly, the program ends. You have 3 guesses, so if you answer 1 incorrectly, the Sphinx takes away 1 guess. Having no guesses left ends the program.


My purpose in making this program is learning C++, and refining my skill to learn.
